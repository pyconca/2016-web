Github's Deployments API allows Github itself to sit in the middle of your deployment pipeline, acting as the glue needed to pull together loosely-coupled deployment tooling. This talk will discuss how the author used Github's Deployments API to connect a chatbot to a custom CI server, allowing for chat-based deploys to a custom Docker-based infrastructure.

## Jay Parlar Bio

Jay is a Hamilton-based software developer at Rackspace, working on internal tools to improve the quality of life of his coworkers. He spends his days writing JavaScript and Python, contributing both to front-end and back-end systems.

He earned his Ph.D. in Software Engineering from McMaster University, where he focused on hard real-time embedded systems and vibration analysis, topics that have little-to-nothing to do with his current job.

Outside of work, Jay spends most of his time with his wife and three kids.
