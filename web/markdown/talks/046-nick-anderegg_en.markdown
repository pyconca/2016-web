This talk details how a distributed application was used to algorithmically compare pairs of Chinese characters for use in psycholinguistic research. By programmatically representing the structure of Chinese characters, it is possible to quantify the similarity of two characters in the same way it is possible to quantify the similarity of two English words by comparing their constituent letters.

## Nick Anderegg Bio

Nick is an MSc student in Cognitive Psychology at Western University, with a primary research area in reading, phonology, and computational psycholinguistics. He earned a BPhil degree in Linguistics and a BA degree in Psychology from Penn State University. He's primarily interested in understanding universal reading processes that speakers of different languages have in common, and how cross-linguistic differences in writing systems and phonology interact with these processes.
