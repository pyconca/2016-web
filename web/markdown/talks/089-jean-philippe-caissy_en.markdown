Shopify strives to be an ever moving company. With a strong force of hundreds in the R&D team, the challenges to keep delivering and shipping scaled accordingly.

From a manual CLI that only ops could execute just a few years back, to today’s automatic 180+ deploys a day, this talk will highlight the different tools, processes and integrations used throughout the team that fuels today's scale.
