We will explore how seemingly simple functions can be layered together to create complex and feature rich topological maps. Watch as each extra layer introduces more interesting, diverse worlds which can be used as images, in games, or as a playground for the curious.

## Michael McHugh Bio

Introduced to Python a decade ago, I now work as a lead engineer at Urban Airship. Originally from Southern Ontario, I moved to Portland, Oregon 4 years ago. I use half a dozen languages on a weekly basis, but Python has always been my go to for experimentation and productivity. Owner of untold hundreds of half finished projects, seeing how far I can push an idea is much more exciting to me than seeing something completed.
