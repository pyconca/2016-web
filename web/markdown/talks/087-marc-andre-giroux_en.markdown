You finish what you think is the best REST API anyone has ever seen. Proud of your work, you decide to post it on the internet and collect the appraisal of you peers.  To your surprise, your API receives comments like "This is not REST! This is simply JSON over HTTP!" or "Oh my god, this is only a level 2 REST API!". It's time to learn how to become a REST elitist and fight back.
