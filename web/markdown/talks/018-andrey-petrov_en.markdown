Being able to run C code from Python is pretty great, but what about running Go code from Python? Or even Python from Go? This talk will walk through the process of executing calls between Python and Go using CFFI bindings to bridge the two runtimes and beyond.

## Andrey Petrov Bio

I write a lot of open source software. My most popular projects are [urllib3](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3) and [ssh-chat](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat).

I like room-scale virtual reality, linux, and p2p systems. I'm a Y-Combinator alumni and Xoogler. I am a Cat person.
