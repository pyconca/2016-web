Lending involves risk and in order to be a successful lender at scale that risk needs to be mitigated. We'll be discussing how C2FO has built a suite of risk management tools for underwriting and portfolio management using the PyData ecosystem, rpy2 (for integrating R), and Spyre (for building a simple web application).
