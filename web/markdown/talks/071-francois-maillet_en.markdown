In this tutorial, we will build a real-time machine learning web app using Python and MLDB.ai. We will use MLDB's Tensorflow integration to use a deep learning model to embed images in a high dimensional conceptual space, and use that representation as features to do transfer learning. This will allow us to build a real-time image classification endpoint.

## François Maillet Bio

François Maillet is a computer scientist specializing in machine learning. He currently leads the machine learning team at MLDB.ai, a Montreal startup building the Machine Learning Database (MLDB).

He's the creator of the Epic NHL goal celebration hack with a hue light show and real-time machine learning presented at Pycon Canada 2015. Previously built an audio fingerprinter used by a TV advertisement monitoring company. He also did research at the Université de Montréal applying machine learning to solve problems related to music recommendation, play list generation and track auto-tagging.
