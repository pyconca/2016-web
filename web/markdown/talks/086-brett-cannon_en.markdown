Jupyter Notebooks provide a way to do "literate computing" where documents contain their own live code and visualizations. And while getting started with notebooks is easy, using cloud-based hosting like Azure Notebooks makes it even easier to get started and share your results. This talk will explain what notebooks are and talk about benefits (and drawbacks) of hosting them in the cloud.

## Brett Cannon Bio

Brett is part of the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) Data Science Tools team at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) where he works on various [Python engineering](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/) problems. He has been a core developer of Python itself for over 13 years and mucked around with pretty much every part of Python at this point. At this point Brett just hopes he can continue to live up to [winning the 2016 Frank Willison Award](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/05/brett-cannon-wins-frank-willison-award.html).
